            <p>ZOLL Medical Corporation has over its history provided support for many activities through corporate sponsorship contributions, gifts and directed research support. The company has funded research in various areas related to pacing, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and basic science in related fields. While ZOLL Medical Corporation will  support directed research specifically related to ZOLL devices, its management has made a strong commitment to provide a source of funding for more basic research that has promise in general to improve resuscitation and critical care.</p>
            <p>In 2013 The ZOLL Foundation  was established  to promote research in resuscitation and acute critical care, as a Massachusetts nonprofit charitable foundation by ZOLL Medical Corporation, a subsidiary of Asahi Kasei.</p>
            <p>Its primary purpose is to provide grants to support research, education and public awareness related to improving resuscitation practices, preventing patient deterioration with associated cardiac arrest and morbidity, and enhancing the care of acute patients to reduce mortality and morbidity.</p>
            <p>As a nonprofit organization, the Foundation can also accept contributions which are tax-deductible from individuals.<sup>1</sup></p>

            <h2>Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Acute Critical Care</h2>
            <p>Sudden cardiac arrest is a major public health problem often unrecognized due to the generally low survival rates associated with efforts at resuscitation. The potential for survival is high - up to 50% of all victims - but overall survival is very low. In the United States it is estimated to be about five percent, and one to two percent in the world. Low survival rates hold true for both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Yet, in some communities and hospitals, and substantial improvements in survival have been demonstrated with the use of newer technologies, better training and improved post-resuscitation care. Survival of up to half of all victims is very possible and rates of survival have doubled and tripled in some hospitals and communities where more attention has been paid to resuscitation capabilities and practices.</p>
            <p>Prevention of cardiac arrest and patient deterioration in both the hospital and out-of-hospital setting has also been demonstrated with reductions in numbers of unexpected cardiac arrests or deterioration of patient conditions due to acute life-threating syndromes. In patients in whom the risk of sudden death has been identified, immediate survival rates as high as 92% have been reported when patients were outfitted with a wearable defibrillator. The gap between survival today--estimated at about 5% in the United states and the 92% survival in at least one population provides a vision of potential survival—and the gap that can be closed between where we are today and where we can be  in the future.  </p>
            <p>While large scale studies and trials are the gold standard for changes in resuscitation and acute care, modest efforts to look at the effects of new technologies or training practices are often the nascent stimulus of later changes in practice and the development of improved technologies and practices. The ZOLL Foundation will focus more on modest efforts in new areas  rather than larger scale studies. </p>

            <h3>Paul M. Zoll, MD</h3>
            <p>ZOLL Medical, founded by Paul M. Zoll, MD in 1981 and others, continues to play a leading and significant role in helping to achieve improvements in the field of resuscitation and acute critical care. Dr. Zoll’s seminal work in electrophysiology, both internal and external defibrillation, cardioversion, external pacing, and mechanical CPR devices provided not only the foundation for the world’s leading company in resuscitation, but a company culture oriented to  new technology and improvements in care provided by that technology in the finest tradition of the company’s namesake. Stimulating and supporting ongoing research in the context of Dr. Zoll’s curiosity and perseverance was one of the fundamental  reasons for the establishment of the ZOLL Foundation.</p>
